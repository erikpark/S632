# So, none of these models appear to fit particularly well, really low p-values from the goodness of fit tests. But, of the three models, we see that the one with only Moist (m3) seems to be the best, according to these tests. Additionally, we see from the summary command that m3 has the lowest AIC of these models.
# Also, from the fourth test above we can reject the null hypothesis that the reduced model, with our factor *moistcat*, fits better than the model with the full *Moist* regressor.
# Also, the addition of the quadratic term for Moist^2 does not seem to significantly improve the model, as seen in the fifth test above versus the reduced model with just *Moist*.
# So, of all the basic poisson models, we see that the model with *Moist* alone fits the best.
# Will now try some tests to see why the deviance is still so high in m3.
